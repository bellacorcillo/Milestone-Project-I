Guess the Word: Bridgerton Edition

Dearest readers, 

The ton is abuzz with the latest gossip - there's a new game to pass the time! Learn all of your favorite Bridgerton-inspired vocabulary with a fun, 'guess the word' game that brings your favorite 'barbs' to life. 

The inspiration was, like this game, simple. I wanted to build something that was elegant in design and clever in choice of words. I knew early on I wanted to do a word game, and when I saw the following article I was inspired to not only make a game that would incorporate the language, but also be educational and showcase both the spelling and meaning of the word in a fun and engaging way.
